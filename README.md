## About
An overengineered snake clone for Android with focus on style, customizability and smooth gameplay. This was a project made mainly during the summer of 2013.

## Code quality
As this is one of SkipIfZero's older projects (never intended to be open sourced in the first place) the code quality is probably not fantastic. But aside from that one of the main reasons the code might be a bit odd was that I was trying really hard to not make the garbage collector gods angry, so objects are basically never destroyed (during gameplay) unless it's unavoidable.

## Google Play Store
